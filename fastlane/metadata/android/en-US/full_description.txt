Thumb-Key is a <i>privacy-conscious</i> smart keyboard, made specifically for your thumbs.

It features a <b>3x3 grid layout</b>, and uses swipes for the less common letters. Its easy to learn, and designed for fast typing speeds.

Instead of relying on profit-driven, privacy-offending word and sentence prediction for accuracy, as do most popular phone keyboards like Gboard and Swiftkey, Thumb-Key uses <b>large keys with predictable positions</b>, to prevent your eyes from hunting and pecking for letters.

As the key positions get ingrained into your muscle memory, eventually you'll be able to appromixate the fast speeds of touch-typing, your eyes never having to leave the text edit area.

This project is a follow-up to the now unmaintained (and closed-source) <a href="https://www.exideas.com/ME/">MessagEase Keyboard</a>, which is its main inspiration.
